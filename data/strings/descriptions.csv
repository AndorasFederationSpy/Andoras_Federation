#astral,SHIP,Text goes here,,,,,,,
sr_miningdrone,SHIP,"Humanity's laziness causes them to create abominations that are hard to understand. These vary from useless massive hulks of battleships to hypercomplicated and incomprehensable quantum engines but sometimes they think simple. The Mordex, an automated mining drone that is attached to mining fleets to increase their effectiveness, is one of them. After the Collapse, the need for mining new resources as well as salvaging old resources increased substantially which lead into the Mordex becoming much more mainstream. There are some nicknames for the Mordex such as ""Resource Hound"" or ""Cheap Exorcist"". Regardless of nicknames, the Mordex is combat and mining proven for usage in void combat and other operations.",,,,,,,
sr_primaevus,SHIP,"As combat in the void became more reliant on wings and usage of missiles for a short period of time, the Primaevus was invented to counteract this style of fight. Carrying a high damage lightning missile, this interceptor wing excels in anti-fighter operations yet fails against massed fighter formations and swarm missiles. Thanks to it's missile some name the Primaevus as ""Javelinier"".",,,,,,,
sr_mastodon,SHIP,"Thanks to the extensive research conducted by Belladona on exotic gases used in mining the Mastodon excels in usage of it's armament. Designed as a heavy yet nimble fighter that will keep the enemy PDs occupied and do some amount of damage while doing so, the Mastodon does it's job fairly well. Its best paired with a group of bombers or when used in swarms against a medium target. After successful escort missions and assault runs, often times the crews would light their cigars against the cooling melted barrels of the LPCs, captains hated it but all even the most by the books officers couldn't say no to the daring crewmen.",,,,,,,
sr_loxodonta,SHIP,"The Loxodonta is the heavier cousin of the Mastodon. It boasts higher firepower as well as heavier armor while maintaining the reliability of the Mastodon. Despite most efforts, the more guns and heavier armor made it a good bit slower, making Loxodonta in need of light escort to fulfill it's duty as an Assault fighter. The Loxodonta in a well equipped fleet can do wonders against the carrier's target while taking a good punch by the enemy PD in the process.",,,,,,,
sr_albicollis,SHIP,"What is better than a large, slow escort corvette? A large, slow phase escort corvette! And the Irritator is just that. One of the largest LPCs to be produced from a ship's mass printers that is both phase capable and an escort wing. Due to the complexity of it's creation, the Irritator puts a large toll on the host ship making it very slow to replace if lost in combat.",,,,,,,
sr_moriorum,SHIP,"When the question of what should some of the slower Belladona ships should do if they come into contact with fast and agile carrier groups, the answer was the Moriorium fighter. This fighter was made to be cheap and comes equipped with two retrofited kenzingtons loaded with anti-armor ammo. The thought process behind it was not to damage and take out enemy capitals, but simply deny the enemy the usability of their fighters while Belladona warships finish the job.",,,,,,,
sr_elephas,SHIP,"Space is full of riches and dangers, and competent space miners are at the core of each space based economy. After cycles of collecting data the Belladona logistics board found that a large amount of crew casualties on mining operations came from unmanned mining drones. This prompted the design of the Elephas manned mining rig, a much more armoured and durable drone that is meant to protect its pilot. The increased size of the rig also allowed the installation of much more powerful equipment, the Krish light plasma flamer, a massive torch that can effectively smelt ores while they are being mined unlike the regular mining lasers. As an added benefit it also became effective in the roles of anti-fighter and support pressure roles.",,,,,,,
sr_melvillei,SHIP,"The pride of the House Belladona fleet, the Melvillei-class Assault Dreadnought. This monster of a ship is designed with extermination in mind, and unlike the lumbering fortresses orbiting House Belladona's planets the Melvillei is fairly mobile for its size. It sports House Belladona's latest engineering innovations designed specifically for the Melvillei, massive blow-out armour plates reminiscent of Old-Earth ERA technology to protect key weapon systems and bridge sections. In addition it also is equipped with the newest generation of auxiliary Vernier engines that assist the massive ship with quick tactical repositioning on the battlefield. Rumours state that the original blueprint was supposed to be equipped with something that appeared to be... A teleportation system using [REDACTED] technology, however on paper, both figuratively and literally, only the current blueprint seems to remain....",,,,,,,
sr_capensis,SHIP,"After several small skirmish incidents where a major issue were harassing frigates, the Capensis was created as a frigate hunter-killer LPC. The Capensis did not live up to be able to take out frigates due to its weapons being underpowered as a result of engineering constraints, however its speed and firepower allow it dominate in the field where LPCs are kings. Due to the pilots often being deployed against troublesome amounts of LPCs, they earned that tag of FS, since most of the time they act as old earth fly swatters. ",,,,,,,
sr_perdix,SHIP,"Flux effecient and fast, the Perdix is a crucial element in many carrier strike operations. It's speed coupled with the ability to go into phase give the Perdix a chance to survive on the battlefield due to skill instead of simple luck. Often used as harassment to not give the enemy a chance to vent the built up flux while the carrier bombers return for a resupply, the pilots of the Perdix got the nickname of ABs (Advanced Bees).",,,,,,,
sr_megalania,SHIP,"The Megalania is a radical change in ship doctrine for House Belladona, fully embracing the concept of ""The best defence is an overwhelming offence"" and overwhelm it does. This ship is in the newest generation of House Belladona ship design, with the capability to slam so much energy into the weapons systems that human assisted targeting becomes impossible, with the insane rate of fire and reload speed from the overclocked weapons systems the crew can really only point the guns in the general direction of the enemy and put on sunglasses to watch the temporary wrath of Belladona hit like the clumsy hammer of a giant. Although the use of the overclocking stresses out years of longevity from the ship components in several seconds, the intent is that the fight should be won swiftly at any cost, and the damage repaired calmly in the peace that follows.",,,,,,,
sr_titanis,SHIP,"Designed to support plantery captures and brutally putting down the crew left alive in disabled ships after a Belladona task group triumphs, the Titanis is the backbone of the Belladona Marines. Although slow and unwieldy for an LPC, it sports enough armour and hull to ignore annoying things like enemy fighters while lumbering towards their target. Fighters that get too careless facing these Titanis LPCs will quickly become a notch on the LPC hatch as they realize their mistake, which among the marines has been dubbed as an ""OnlyDeath subscription count"".",,,,,,,
sr_thunderwing,SHIP,"Belladona previous carrier tactics were less about direct ship damage and was more about simple area denial of opposing LPCs to give the Belladona fleets an uninterrupted approach towards the enemy's main fleet. During a standard brief about available fleet resources between House Belladona Main Fleet Command and The Lusus Naturae Project Engineer Corp one of the Project Engineers chuckled and stated that some of their ships could probably fit a whole destroyer on their deck, let alone some random fighters if he was allowed to get his hands on them. Repeating the newfound idea to himself he quickly submitted an application to the LCDB (light-craft design bureau) for a request with a destroyer sized craft that will effectively contain nothing but a shield, engines, and a LOT of weapons. When asked to clarify on how many is a LOT, he answered that they should imagine a number called ""Yes multiplied by More, and then add one."" [Attached Note: ""Please refrain from submitting destroyer class ship designs to the LCDB in the future.""]",,,,,,,
sr_bennetti,SHIP,"An attempt by Belladona engineers and officers to give an element of surprise to carrier based operations after their industrial base had expanded significantly. The Bennetti only has one weapon, an anti ship nuclear warhead, which it struggles to carry since the weapon payload wasn't downsized from its intended role as a ship-launched missile. The crew of these bombers were dubbed the gamblers since for them any run is a go big or go home run.",,,,,,,
sr_dinictis,SHIP,"Effectively a few weapon mounts slapped onto two cruiser sized engines, the Dinictis is one of the fastest frigates in this side of the sector. The design approach was simple, why design new engines and take away precious game time away from engineers, when you can just take bigger engines and everyone is happy. In the blueprints there is a hard-coded sign to ""Keep your eyes on the road pilot!"" next to the pilots head because crashing into anything in the Dinictis will have less than desired results.",,,,,,,
sr_daeodon,SHIP,"A personally designed custom frigate by Victor Belladonas predecessor at the head of salvage department, the Daeodon is what came to life. Intended as a military escort vehicle for medium sized fleets of civilian or scavenger ships, the Daeodon is a jack of all trades but master of none, it will struggle against faster ships, brawler doctrine, and other approaches, but it is a cheap ship who's goal is to give valuable time for salvager crews to escape with their hauls.",,,,,,,
sr_baryonyx,SHIP,"A prime example of military simplicity, the Baryonyx-class is simply a Colossus BP (Acquired through fair honest trade of course.) heavily modified for House Belladona usage shorty after arriving in the Andoras System. A massive cargo ship created more for the purpose of unloading the massive amounts of materials and wealth stored on the House Belladona Generation Ships. Padded with military level cargo shielding and elite gunnery crews on board it makes even the greediest pirate think twice when looking for their next score. It was designed with the help of 'Anton Belladona' who intended to expand House Belladonas future through large volume trade of raw ore and materials. If you let House Belladona Exploratory and Salvage crews tell the story though they like to claim it was made solely for them.",,,,,,,
sr_bandersnatch,SHIP,"One of the most feared carriers created by House Belladona dedicated solely to area denial of enemy LPCs, the Bandersnatch fleet carrier is essential in modern Belladona doctrine. Equipped exclusively with fighter wings, the Bandersnatch gives a sinking feeling to any bomber focused carrier crews of any opposing fleet. Belladona Aces who test highest for [REDACTED] and [REDACTED] are crewed here exclusively. More often than not these maniacal patriots prove to be loose cannons. They will try to pull off dangerous maneuvers to assert dominance over their enemies; some officers believe it was a mistake to give the pilots Old-Earth movies featuring dogfights to boost moral.",,,,,,,
sr_imparatus,SHIP,"Built on the same base principal as the Megalania, the Imparatus Class assault cruiser is able to throw obscene amounts of firepower in a short amount of time. The Imparatus was made with the intention to be used in tandem with support ships or other Imparatus class ships to quickly finish off ships even above their own weight class by sheer overwhelming amount of rounds put down range. After the ship was introduced into the mainline fleet lineup, it quickly earned the nickname of ""Little Mega"".",,,,,,,
sr_insularis,SHIP,"An escort carrier made to ward off destroyers and smaller classes of ships in fleet battles, the Insularis class assault carriers main role is direct ground support. It's marines are trained in direct orbital strike simulators on potential predetermined assault sites to provide accurate tactical support in future battles.",,,,,,,
sr_jabberwock,SHIP,"After the engineers in The 'Lusus Naturae Project' finally succeeded in completing its first phase ship research program, House Belladona high command decided that instead of undertaking the massive task of overhauling fleet doctrine and tactics they would instead be used for a final field test in salvager mining fleets. The newly appointed Head of Salvage Operations 'Victor Belladona' readily signed off on this modernization because he knew how valuable phase ships could be in cluttered debris fields, asteroid environments and during volatile ore extractions, where using phase excels the most. The Jabberwock became the first phase ship of the Belladona Navy to enter active service and has served House Belladona salvage crews by providing security and assisting in salvaging operations for cycles. Although it is a militarized combat ship, it still retains some of its previous functionality as a salvage ship, albeit repurposed to repair the inevitable bumps and scrapes that occur in this line of work more than extract ore and collect salvage.",,,,,,,
sr_mellori,SHIP,"The brain child of an ex-Salvage Department officer that rose through the ranks and joined the Main Belladona Navy, the Mellori class heavy cruiser proves to be a hot little ship. The key features of the Mellori is that it is armed with two heavy, inefficient, but powerful Krish flamers, as well as modular heavy armour pieces. Although it isn't fast, it can take a beating and shred anything that has its armour exposed to its flamers. Crews aboard the Mellori are quite fond of unleashing their molten payload into any enemy hull breaches they can find, almost instantly filling all connected passageways with instant death.",,,,,,,
sr_montcellia,SHIP,"Commissioned from Tri-Tachyon before the collapse, the Montcellia class phase ship was originally intended as a spy ship during an era when subspace sensors were not included in standard sensor packages. During the preparation for the Great House Migration to the Andoras System it was repurposed into a deep space exploration and survey vessel. It is now kept in reserve as a light early warning picket ship, only periodically getting blueprint updates for advancements in sensor technology. It also is sold at a fairly affordable price to commissioned officers and aspiring starfarers. ",,,,,,,
sr_muensteri,SHIP,"Designed and produced in accordance with Belladona's LPC carrier expansion program. The Muensteri is a frontline battlecarrier meant to support allied capitals and ward away anything smaller than battlecruisers. It has a larger internal hanger size than it does LPC control centers, so it unfortunately can't field it's full amount of wings for an extended period of time.",,,,,,,
sr_panthera,SHIP,"Originally designed as a large combat tanker, one influential Belladona officer pushed through the idea of designing a massive flamer bigger than even conventional superdreadnought engines and using the tankers antimatter fuel as ammo. The wide funnel of the Moon Smelter spits a long range torrent of antimatter, that when it materializes brings with itself enough energy to glass planetoid surfaces, there is no doubt that it's effect against unshielded armour and hull will have catastrophic chain reactions. To this day there are many officers and Belladona cadets who debate his design decisions and call him a genius or a madman, sometimes both. Regardless of what you think of the design all sides can agree that its best to stay as far as possible when a Panthera is on the prowl.",,,,,,,
sr_taxideataxus,SHIP,"A cost-inefficent and under equipped in almost all aspects carrier, The Taxidea-Taxus sports one single equally massive advantage, a massive fleet cracker ship, the Levaillanti. The logic behind this construction is simple, how effective would a specialized combat hull be if you strip out everything absolutely unnecessary to combat, and the numbers the brass saw were very impressive. As a result, the Taxidea-Taxus is effectively a launch platform for the Levaillanti, the internals of which have been stripped clean of repair modules, spare parts storage, antimatter fuel tanks, and any life support since the crew operate the ship in skintight space suits with oxygen tanks, the goal of stripping out all but the essentials from the interior was to make room for additional hangar bays below the flight deck to allow for small amount of fighter escort wings. The Taxidea-Taxus' unorthodox design has caused the death of the unprepared, and even many of its prepared opponents. ",,,,,,,
sr_constantina,SHIP,"Initial project designs of the Constantina envisioned a frontline torepdo powerhouse, however the head of the ""Lusus Naturae Project"", a specialized organization that reports directly to top military commanders and often gets requisitions from the Grand Marshal-Admiral himself about potential changes in fleet doctrine, was notified that the House Belladona navy lacked logistical support. A quick revision was done by LNP Engineers of current design projects to find a suitable hull to expand the logistical ranks of House Belladona with. That is how the Constantina came to be a Salvage & Repair Missile Carrier, 25% of its armour and hull were stripped to fit in a scaled down SRMB (Station Repair and Manufactury Bay) that allows for the Constantina to help repair small to medium size damage on ships, and support the fleet. Its able to provide long to mid range support by keeping making sure its missile stores dont run dry using the secondary function of the SRMB, it is also able to provide in-combat armor and hull repairs through the use of its Silvestris Repair Drones which also aid in out of combat salvage operations these are paired alongside a wing of Mordex Mining Drones to assist in ship-breaking and mining operations when the Constantina is used to escort Belladona Mining Fleets. It is not made for the frontline, but can provide serious support while its comrades fight in front. ",,,,,,,
sr_miragaia,SHIP,"Many engineers hate big ships with complex designs and arguably hard-to-maintain interiors, The Miragaia is not one of them for sure. Designed around two key concepts, one being deep-space-salvage or DSS operations as well as Missile Swarm Support operations or MSS. The Miragaia's interior is vast and easy to navigate, one of the main compartments of the ship is solely designated for the Swarm Battery part of the ship. The Gregaria Swarm Battery is a formidable swarm missile launcher with mass autofactory arrays build in the ship's very skin. Miragaia or Mira in some engineer's terms is the perfect ship for a fleet with larger battleships.",,,,,,,
sr_rafetus,SHIP,"A prototype battlecarrier outfitted with ancient ablative armor, an experimental hangar design, and a heavy escort corvette the Rafetus-Class Battlecarrier is a menacing presence on the battlefied fit for deployment in almost any engagement. The Rafetus-Class' ablative armor was painstakingly recovered from the Melvillei-Class dreadnought lost in the final battle against House Augustus in the brief War of Cycle 197 after championing the Belladona Naval Fleet through a swift and bloody retaliatory campaign. After a long and delicate recovery operation spanning multiple cycles undamaged sections of the ancient ablative armor were removed from the otherwise ruined ship by engineering crews from the House Belladona Lusus Naturae Project. As the most recent generation of ship from the LNP and the one that took the longest from drawing board to production, the Rafetus is a rare and highly sought after ship acting as the unwavering backbone of any fleet lucky enough to have one. Boasting numerous bays, missile mounts and decent PD coverage, it is able to cover the backs of the more specialized hull designs that House Belladona fields. Although it is a bit slow as an escort in the tactical field, it sports heavier armour than almost any other battlecruiser would normally be equipped with in the Persean Sector, and the ships A.W.A.R.D. Hyper Gyro System ensures that anything foolish enough to engage it directly will not be brawling with an easy target. ",,,,,,,
sr_hyaena,SHIP,"More of an overtuned weapons testing platform for the Lusus Naturae Project instead of a proper warship, the Hyaena-class Destroyer can throw a shocking amount of supportive firepower if properly deployed, but it doesn't fair well against direct firepower. Its armament consists of several experimental weapons developed by the Belladonan navy, two Gurzil Hullbuster Batteries, and the Crocuta Autocannon, both of which are during their final testing phases. There is so little space for crew operations aboard this ship that they are forced to squeeze their way to their stations, some rumours exist that the testing crew have to be limited by height during the screening process. The crew have mockingly dubbed this ship design the ""Glass Cannon"", since while it looks mighty on paper and can throw punches above its weight class, it quickly withers under any direct focus.",,,,,,,
sr_salvinii,SHIP,"The Salvinii-Class Corvette is a commanding presence in the realm of escort vessels, meticulously crafted to protect the massive Rafetus-Class Battlecarrier. Engineered with agility as its hallmark, the Salvinii stands ready to counter any threat with its formidable armament. At the forefront is its primary weapon, a full-size Kenzington Multi-Flak cannon mounted in the prow, accompanied by a Kenzington Torrent PD positioned atop the hull, facing aft. This arsenal is the cornerstone of the Salvinii's defensive capabilities, purpose-built for intercepting and neutralizing enemy projectiles and spacecraft. The Salvinii's answer to almost all incoming threats is its multi-barreled flak cannon, an engineering marvel of a full size cannon that forms the core of the corvette. Each barrel is precision-calibrated to unleash a torrent of high-velocity flak, creating a lethal storm of shrapnel capable of decimating enemy fighters and missiles alike. Complementing this primary armament is a single secondary weapon, the Kenzington Torrent PD gun, strategically placed in the rear to give the Salvinii the ability to engage threats from all directions, ensuring the corvette's versatility in all combat scenarios. With its menacing silhouette, the Salvinii commands attention from all LPC's in its AO, its streamlined hull is optimized for speed and agility. Despite its compact design, the Salvinii manages to maximize defensive capabilities without compromising any maneuverability, making it an indispensable asset in any engagement.",,,,,,,
sr_repairdrone,SHIP,"Often used in small station outposts and asteroid mining rigs as a mobile repair bot, the Silvestris is occasionally utilized in Belladonan fleets as a small tactical repair unit. Although it has no armaments, it is built to withstand lots of punishment, most often from things like asteroids but it has enough armour to withstand considerable fire for its size from the enemy while making its repairs. If a ship is saved by the operators of the Silvestris, its Belladona Navy tradition to bankroll the operators next visit to the bar.",,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,,
sr_krishflamer,WEAPON,"Primarily utilized by salvage ships to quickly smelt scrap ship armour or asteroid chunks for precious metals, the Krish Flamer is the staple salvage tool of the Belladona Salvage Department. It has enough range that even though it's flux inefficient in a last ditch effort it can make for a decent self defence weapon in space, and no sane captain will strap more flamers than needed to their ship right.....?",,,,,,,
sr_permiana,WEAPON,"Belladona engineers were asked to solve the issue of cowardly enemies fleeing the battlefield before its over and in response they created this, The Permiana DEM Swarm. The Permiana launches a swarm of heat seeking missiles that bombard the engines and rear of an enemy ship with the intention of turning the enemy engines into molten slag. ",,,,,,,
sr_enca,WEAPON,"An inspiration taken from Old Earth conflicts in an era when long ranged missiles played a critical role in national strategy, the Enca LRMIRV was designed as a space equivalent of a MIRV missile. It uses a massive missile to efficiently deliver the payload into striking range, medium sized missiles to close to effective engagement range, and up to 18 small emp warheads. This weapon can completely disable ships if the enemies come under fire from several support ships.",,,,,,,
sr_terriblefate,WEAPON,"In response to new innovations and advancements in missile weapons within the sector, Belladonan engineers came up with something to not fall behind. The ""Forbidden Knowledge"", or FK, became Belladonas ultimate so called ""nuclear"" weapon. Although it is stated that it uses nuclear reactions, it is commonly known that nuclear explosions don't have the same damage potential in space due to lack of atmosphere, [REDACTED BY ZHIMMER BELLADONA] claim that somehow the FK manages to produce a shockwave in space. These unexplained and weird phenomena were often debated by [REDACTED] and [REDACTED], however the only thing they agreed upon was that this weapon has a frightening origin. Any further mention about where it came from or how it can be made haven't been found, or possibly shouldn't ever be found...",,,,,,,
sr_cornixlauncher,WEAPON,"A simple and reliable rocket system, the Cornix Shield Suppressor does exactly what the name implies. Sporting a staggered but rapid launch of 50 missiles of the hardest thickest metal Belladona could weld an engine to, the Cornix can reliably suppress shields and ready the field for the ballistics to finish the job. In addition due to the missiles having fairly exceptional tracking and speed, it is one of the more effective weapons Belladona has at telling smaller classes of ships that they are trying to pick a fight with the wrong weight class.",,,,,,,
sr_freezer,WEAPON,"An experimental piece of weaponry that was created during the recent innovation drive by Belladona, the Krryolix uses near absolute-zero temperature shells, and even physics as its weapon to tear through armour. Due to such severe temperature changes it corrodes the hull and easily decompresses ships due to it causing massive internal damage. Ironically the crew that services these odd weapons are often called Hotheads because maintaining such a complicated piece of equipment capable of reaching such low temperatures would make any engineers blood boil. ",,,,,,,
sr_wavebreaker,WEAPON,"Initially, although most find it incredibly hard to believe, the Wavebreaker was initially meant to have only 2 barrels. However, during the design process, under the arguments and heated yelling of one eccentric junior engineer, 2 barrels became 4 and then 4 became 6. This causes the weapon to quickly overheat the main ships flux storage but by then the job would already be done; several dozen massive shells would have already been slammed into the enemies hull either crippling them or leaving them as drifting space debris. When one of the Belladona Marines and friend of the junior engineer asked how he managed to convince the design team, he answered: ""When they showed us the initial variant with two barrels, I shouted 'More!' At them, and then the same thing when the four barrel prototype was made"". If you trace the rumor back to that marine he also swears something very similar happened for the Troika.",,,,,,,
sr_barbeque,WEAPON,"The Krish light plasma flamer was developed as an alternative method to mining lasers, however it proved to be much too flux inefficient for regular mining drones. When the Elephus Mining Rig was created, there were many heated debates between engineers and Belladona logistics officers to install 4 mining lasers or a Krish flamer. Eventually after many hours of debate, one destroyed testing rig, and 3 asteroids melted together, the engineers were finally convinced of its effectiveness.",,,,,,,
sr_fightermg,WEAPON,"The Kenzingtons Deluge is a retrofitted kenzington machine gun that is equipped with anti-armor rounds instead and its range is cut down in favor of faster fire and reload rate. The deluge is by essence, a space superiority weapon that can only be effectively utilized on fighters.",,,,,,,
sr_livyatan,WEAPON,"The Livyatan Railgun blueprint was initially started as a secret moon killer weapon that would be used to target Planet-bound military installations or moons that were considered too risky to be assaulted with space forces. The plans were to use it as an extremely long range railgun for bombardments outside the range of enemy defences. However with the power balance within the Andoras Federation shifted in House Belladona's favour, the need for complete destruction of enemy positions was discarded since Belladona would soon be able to take control of them through conventional means and keep them. As a result, Livyatan was modified to be fitted into a dreadnought hull in order to instead target enemy capital ships and strategic space defences. As one officer quoted an old-earth famous phrase: ""It's a weapon made to ""finish the fight"", so to speak"".",,,,,,,
sr_zapfighter,WEAPON,"As the name indicates, Zaps are a Directed Energy Missile or DEM in short used to disable enemy vessel's armaments and engines with a brief burst of EMP energy. The biggest upside the Zap platform provides is it's verstility. It can be used as a damage dealer and a disabler. Zap's come in diffirent sizes dependent on the ship's mounts.",,,,,,,
sr_zaprack,WEAPON,"As the name indicates, Zaps are a Directed Energy Missile or DEM in short used to disable enemy vessel's armaments and engines with a brief burst of EMP energy. The biggest upside the Zap platform provides is it's verstility. It can be used as a damage dealer and a disabler. Zap's come in diffirent sizes dependent on the ship's mounts.",,,,,,,
sr_zapbrannigan,WEAPON,"As the name indicates, Zaps are a Directed Energy Missile or DEM in short used to disable enemy vessel's armaments and engines with a brief burst of EMP energy. The biggest upside the Zap platform provides is it's verstility. It can be used as a damage dealer and a disabler. Zap's come in diffirent sizes dependent on the ship's mounts.",,,,,,,
sr_lancer_tri,WEAPON,"A test variant that was supposedly rejected at Gustav Belladona's personal space weapons poligon and never put into production, the Tri-opsis Lancer Battery blueprint was not deleted. Having much more firepower than it's mainline version, the prototype lancer packs a punch, in addition, it cuts out the long range targeting systems to make room for an over-driven autoloader but this has the unfortunate downside of losing great amounts of accuracy. It seems the engineers who rumoured about its existence were right. ",,,,,,,
sr_lancer_dual,WEAPON,"Based on old earth armements, the Sinopsis Lancer battery takes its name from an ancient psychological condition that was caused severe neurodivergency that causes the person to experience self doubt even though they are doing their task perfectly. The Sinopsis excels as an anti-shield weapon while maintaining its simple looks, beneath the metal hide its hypercomplex targeting arrays. Engineers admire the Lancer's simple but effecient construction that holds a beauty of its own. Some previous designs were proposed with a tri-barrel approach but adding one more barrel severely cut into targeting efficiency. Hence the two barreled version is the mainline, however engineers rumour about tri barrel prototypes that may still exists... ",,,,,,,
sr_killer,WEAPON,"The Kickback Linked Repeater is a steadfast and reliable mainline weapon designed by House Belladona. This medium-sized repeater offers a balance of power and flexibility, making it an indispensable choice for a range of engagements and ship classes. Equipped with high-explosive (HE) rounds, the Kickback Linked Repeater excels in anti-armour capabilities. Its straightforward yet effective design allows for sustained fire, ensuring a consistent and formidable assault against armored adversaries that is best shown with multiple repeaters. This mainline weapon is a workhorse, trusted by Belladona crews navigating the challenges of the cosmic frontier. ",,,,,,,
sr_troika,WEAPON,"Created as a weapon that could both deal efficient light armour damage and help out mining operations, the Troika is a thermal autocannon of all trades. Inherently a crude and somewhat outdated design, Troika is most often seen in use by Belladonan salvage fleets due to its flexibility and simple maintenance, often done onboard the ship during mining operations. Some onboard technicians claim that after fixing something like the Krryolix as one of their military graduation projects, fixing a Troika for them is almost therapy.",,,,,,,
sr_takeaknee,WEAPON,"The Genuflector is a capital grade slag shotgun that was made to devastate entire sections of starship armor. The Genuflector boasts a medium range of fire with a devastating spread of projectiles. Its unique ammunition is made up of highly volatile exotic slag that is majorly unstable and highly charged with EMP energy causing the projectiles to disable electronic systems, and molten slag to melt through armor upon contact.",,,,,,,
sr_thirtyfour,WEAPON,"Any missile will malfunction if it has enough metal rods slammed through its inner workings, taking those words to heart, made as a capstone project by a young engineer in the Belladonan military academy, the torrent was created. True to its name, it spits a torrent of steel rods which are often the end point for incoming missiles, and due to its highly kinetic nature, it doubles as efficient shield pressure, assuming the ship can get close enough.",,,,,,,
sr_slavodan,WEAPON,"The Nadovals Tri-Render is a massive installation with 3 rotary autocannons. Due to the lack of a sufficient caliber the weapon tends to underperform against shields and heavy armour, but excels at tearing through hull and lightly armoured targets. Rumours say that the idea for such a gun was brought up from some forgotten war from Old-earth by a young officer trying to rise through the ranks. According to an officer in the military archives, the historical inspiration of this was called the Shilka""",,,,,,,
sr_beryl,WEAPON,The Beryl Disruptor was an early protoype plasma cannon with extraordinarily high flux output. This makes it borderline unusable to the point where only ships with massive flux grids can use it with any amount of success. Even with modifications it's flux generation is crippling yet the trade-off for this amount of flux generation is a massive damage output that has a medium chance to effect other parts of an enemy's vessel by using the target's own artifical gravity field to disperse the plasma across it's body.,,,,,,,
sr_pantheraflamer,WEAPON,"Originally used as a very heavy mining tool for on-site-smelting of resource rich Moons and Asteroids, Belladona's design took ques from old-world smelteries. Blasting hyper-heated volatile gasses into a jet and setting it on fire while being mixed with exotic gasses, causing the gases to burn in a vivid blue color. This was very useful for mining asteroids and moons but did not really work well on nebulas. Despite it's main purpose, Belladona quickly found it being used on the frontline after a small incident when it was stationed to guard a mining fleet, earning the nickname ""Hegemon Blaster"" due to it's potent armor melting capabilities. ",,,,,,,
sr_kitchensink,WEAPON,"This weapon is the result of many generations of fine tuning a weapon once made in bleak times of desperation, where large stores of ammunition were scarce. Now, it is a refined instrument of war willing to take almost anything you put in it and put out a steady stream of death. Gunnery Crews are reportedly quite fond of the gun with multiple reports saying - ""She'll take anything you throw in and she'll just keep on firing, you could even toss in the Kitchen Sink and it wouldn't even slow down."" ",,,,,,,
sr_dbm,WEAPON,"The Eidmi is functionally not much more than a Sinder ripped from a Peromyscus Fighter with engines welded on and a cheap targeting computer attached but the engineers who worked on it would lay awake in bed at night if they knew starship crews using their weapon thought that. In response they would say, The Eidmi is a stripped down and reinforced Sinder with capacitors critically overcharged and mounted onto a pair of twin Micro Viper engines with a highly sophisticated and efficient targeting computer which also runs the subroutines to stabilize the weapons platform as it fires. In reality, Sun Industries took the perfected version of this weapon and swapped out every component for their much cheaper in-house counterparts before finalizing the design resulting in a weapon that struggles to deliver its payload before shooting itself off target. Among the fleet it is notoriously unpopular almost entirely due to it's unreasonably high number of friendly fire incidents and not being able to deliver it's full payload reliably even on larger targets.",,,,,,,

All of these factors together give the Jabberwock a major edge when brawling other ships in its weight class however this puts extreme stress on the superstructure of the ship. Due to permanent superstructure damage causing multiple prototypes to need to be scrapped, the system can only be used a limited nymber of times per engagement.",SPECIAL,"Powers down weapons while it reroutes primary and auxiliary reactor power into the weapons systems and [REDACTED].
